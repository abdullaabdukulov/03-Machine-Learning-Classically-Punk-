## Task
Music. For a long time, experts have tried to understand the sound and what makes one song different from another. What makes one tone different from another? Can we imagine sound, and if so, how? Audio files contain a lot of data, and our goal is to understand what an audio file is, the data it contains, and what we can do with that data. What characteristics can we imagine in this type of data?

## Description
Your first task will be to find a library that will "read" the music. (Computers don't listen to music, they read it :)  Then your second task will be to sort the collection of music files into different music genres, and for this you will first need to identify the features within the music. music files used for classification.

What to expect: Create a program in Python that automatically classifies different musical genres from an audio clip. You should expect to manage large data sets. You should also expect to analyze media files to generate data and identify patterns.
