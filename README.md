## Description
Music experts have long sought to unravel the mysteries of sound, exploring what sets one song apart from another. What distinguishes one tone from the next? And can we visualize sound? Audio files are rich in data, offering a window into the intricacies of music. Our objective is to delve into the anatomy of an audio file, deciphering its contents and exploring the possibilities it presents. What key features can we extract and visualize from this data?

My initial task is to locate a library capable of “reading” music (since computers don’t actually listen to music, they read it). Subsequently, I aim to segregate a group of music files into distinct genres. To achieve this, I will need to identify features within the music files that can be utilized for classification.

What to anticipate: The development of a Python application that autonomously categorizes various music genres based on audio snippets. This application should be capable of handling substantial datasets and analyzing media files to extract data and recognize patterns.

## Installation
If you haven't installed the necessary libraries, run the following command in a code cell to install them:
```bash
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly seaborn  matplotlib tensorflow librosa IPython
```
